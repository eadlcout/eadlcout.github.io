  <h2 class="header">About Me</h2>
  <p class="outside">I'm a Canadian soon-to-be graduate of the University of Waterloo with a degree in Honours English: Media, Professional Communication, and Rhetoric. I specialized in Digital Media Studies and Technical Writing, with minors in Computer Science and East Asian studies, so I am well-prepared for today's global, tech-oriented industries. My <b>resume</b> is <a href="resume.html">here.</a></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">Google Firebase</h3>
<p class="outside">In my Technical Communications course at University of Waterloo, we were put in contact with Google HQ in Waterloo to help copyedit public-facing technical documentation instructing app developers on how to get started with their mobile app enhancement suites. Here is a sampling of my work on this project, all of which were written and edited using Markdown.</p>
<h4>JavaScript Quickstart</h4>
<p class="outside">This project's readme file required structural edits to improve readability as well as minor grammatical corrections.</p>

  <h4>Firebase Auth Quickstart</h4>
  <p>The Firebase auth quickstart demonstrates several methods for signing in.</p>
  <p>The Firebase email/password quickstart demonstrates <span class="highlight">using a Firebase stored email &amp; password -</span> you can both create and sign in a user.</p>
  <p>The Firebase <span class="highlight">Google Sign in quickstarts</span> demonstrate using a <span class="highlight">Google account</span> to authenticate to Firebase using three different techniques: with a popup, a redirect <span class="highlight">and</span> an auth token.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">The Firebase Facebook Login quickstarts demonstrate using a Facebook account to authenticate to Firebase using three different techniques: with a popup, a redirect and an auth token.</span></p>
  <p>The Firebase <span class="highlight">GitHub Login quickstarts</span> demonstrate using a <span class="highlight">GitHub account</span> to authenticate to Firebase using two different techniques: with a popup and a redirect.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">The Firebase Twitter Login quickstarts demonstrate using a Twitter account to authenticate to Firebase using two different techniques: with a popup and a redirect.</span></p>
  <p>The Firebase Anonymous <span class="highlight">auth</span> quickstart demonstrates <span class="highlight">authenticate</span> to Firebase anonymously.</p>
  <p>The <span class="highlight">Firebase custom auth web</span> quickstart demonstrates how to authenticate to Firebase with a user who has been authenticated from your own pre-existing authentication system. This is done by generating a token in a specific format, which is signed using the private key from a service account downloaded from the Google Developer Console. This token can then be passed to your client application which uses it to authenticate to Firebase.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Set up your project on the <a>Firebase Console</a>.</li>
    <li>Enable the authentication method you want to use in the <strong>Auth &gt; SIGN IN METHOD</strong> tab. You do not need to enable Custom Authentication.</li>

    <li>For Facebook, Twitter and GitHub you will need to create an application as a developer on their developer platform and whitelist <code>https://&lt;project_id&gt;.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler</code> for auth redirects.

<h4>iOS Quickstart</h4>
<p class="outside">Many of the iOS documents were simple edits such as adding commas or periods as needed. In this particular document, I had to catch and escape a greater-than (&lt;) character that was interfering with Markup and causing text not to be displayed.</p>
<div class="before">
  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a>Add Firebase to your iOS Project</a>.</li>
    <li>In web/public/apple-app-site-association file, replace <span class="highlight">with your App ID or your Team ID</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Get</span> the <a>Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI)</a><span class="highlight"> Step 1</span></li>
    <li>Run <code>firebase init</code>.
      <ul>
        <li>Select your current Firebase project.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Hit</span> Enter to select the default public directory as your website root.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run <code>firebase deploy</code>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Capabilities</strong> tab of XCode, turn on <strong>Associated Domains</strong>. Add your Firebase hosting domain in the format <span class="highlight">applinks:</span>. Do not include <span class="highlight">"https://"</span>. You can find your Firebase hosting domain in the Hosting section of the Firebase console.</li>

  <h3 style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">MongoDB</h3>
  <p class="outside">For MongoDB, I did a syntactical edit of the "Text Indexes" document in their user manual, preparing it for style editing. I mainly made simple grammatical fixes, such as adding missing words or improving sentence flow and clarity. As the entire document is quite long, I will only include excerpts. All work was done in Sphinx markup language.</p>

    <p>Wildcard text indexes, as with all text indexes, can be part of a compound index<span class="highlight">es</span>. For example, the following creates a compound index on the field <strong><code>a</code></strong> as well as the wildcard specifier:</p>
    <p class="quote">db.collection.createIndex( { a: 1, "$**": "text" } )</p>
    <p>As with all <a>compound text indexes</a>, since the a precedes the text index key, in order to perform a <a class="code">$text</a> search with this index, the query predicate must include an equality match <span class="highlight">conditions <strong><code>a</code></strong></span>. For information on compound text indexes, see <a>Compound Text Indexes</a>.</p>

  <h1>Further Information</h1>
  <p class="outside">I am very proficient in the Microsoft Office suite of programs, especially including Microsoft Word and Excel. I am good with various Adobe applications, such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Acrobat, and InDesign. I know several programming languages and markup languages, meaning I can easily pick up specific languages as well as understand code to write technical documentation.</p>
